{"name":"Paul van Meekeren","team":"","battingStyle":"Right hand Bat","bowlingStyle":"Right arm Fast medium","playingRole":"Bowler","description":"Paul van Meekeren drew attention to himself during the World Twenty20 qualifiers in 2016 when he produced a spell of 4 for 11 against Ireland. A trial match at Taunton Vale, plus the success of his Dutch compatriot Timm van der Gugten at Glamorgan, was enough for Somerset to offer him a short-term deal midway through the 21016 season which they extended to a two-year deal until the end of the 2018 season. He made his Somerset first-class debut against the Pakistan tourists and followed up with T20 and List-A debuts for the Club in the same season, catching the eye in a NatWest T20 Blast fixture at Cardiff where he bowled with genuine pace. The following season, in his sole Championship appearance, he took four wickets on debut against Essex at Chelmsford.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff"}
