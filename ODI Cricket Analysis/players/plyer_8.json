During the Lord's Ashes Test against England in August 2019, Steven Smith was felled by Jofra Archer's bouncer and Labuschagne would become his concussion substitute - the first time in Test history the protocol had been used. By the end of the year he had eclipsed Smith as the leading Test run-scorer in the world, and locked in the No. 3 spot, in the midst of a prolific home summer that brought him four centuries in five matches against Pakistan and New Zealand including a double century at the SCG."}
