{"name":"Dhananjaya de Silva","team":"","battingStyle":"Right hand Bat","bowlingStyle":"Right arm Offbreak","playingRole":"Allrounder","description":"A technically correct top-order batsman from the southern reaches of the island, Dhananjaya de Silva briefly caught the national selectors' eye in 2015, then went on to have a bumper domestic season that marked him out for more intensive national duty. De Silva had been picked on potential in Sri Lanka's mid-year T20s against Pakistan, in 2015, but didn't quite convince he was a T20 batsman, hitting 45 off 47 balls across two innings. What followed, though, was an emphatic blooming."}
