{"name":"Mark Chapman","team":"","battingStyle":"Left hand Bat","bowlingStyle":"Slow Left arm Orthodox","playingRole":"Allrounder","description":"Born in Hong Kong, but qualifying for New Zealand through his father, Chapman began his international career with the country of his birth in 2014 having previously made the Under-19 squad as a 15-year-old. He made a century on ODI debut against UAE in 2015 having flown 20 hours following exams in New Zealand, but soon decided to throw his lot in with New Zealand and focused on his career with Auckland. His first New Zealand call-up came in early 2018 for the T20 tri-series involving England and Australia. It was reward for a prolific 2017-18 white-ball season by the left-hander, who scored over 300 runs in the Super Smash and more than 400 in the one-day Ford Trophy. He also bowls part-time left-arm spin which he has been encouraged to continue to work on. As a teenager he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee playing rugby in New Zealand but it did not stall his cricket career.\nESPNcricinfo staff"}
