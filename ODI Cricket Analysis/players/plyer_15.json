{"name":"Adam Zampa","team":"","battingStyle":"Right hand Bat","bowlingStyle":"Legbreak Googly","playingRole":"Bowler","description":"An energetic and competitive legspinner, Adam Zampa emerged in Australia's limited-overs squads in 2016 after a successful summer for South Australia and the Melbourne Stars. In T20, especially, he has proven a hard man to get away, with subtle changes of pace and variations, including a wrong'un and straight ball making up for a lack of prodigious turn. He's a (mullet-wearing) colourful character off the field, but in contrast, his bowling, focusing on control, is clinical."}
