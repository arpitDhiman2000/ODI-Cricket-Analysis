His ability to make unconventional shots - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example -appear routine makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. Maxwell's audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fielder, Maxwell offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click. "}
