{"name":"Mahmudullah","team":"","battingStyle":"Right hand Bat","bowlingStyle":"Right arm Offbreak","playingRole":"Allrounder","description":"An allrounder who bowls tidy offspin and bats in the middle order, Mahmudullah has spent the last three years figuring out how fickle form can be. In late 2012, he was the star who derailed West Indies to their first ODI series defeat in Bangladesh, and was a step away from captaincy. A poor season later, his place was continually questioned and he was even dropped for the 2014 Asia Cup. After another five months, Mahmudullah finally found form and became an automatic choice."}
