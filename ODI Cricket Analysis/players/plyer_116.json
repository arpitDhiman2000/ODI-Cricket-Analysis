Shaidi started his journey in the Under-17 side and was included in Afghanistan's squad for the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. Four years later, he was part of the Under-19 team that beat Australia and Sri Lanka, and was rewarded with a spot in the squad for Afghanistan's first full tour of Zimbabwe. His favourite shot is the cover-drive and he idolises Kumar Sangakkara.Liam Brickhill"}
