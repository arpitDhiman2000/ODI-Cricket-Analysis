{"name":"Mitchell Starc","team":"","battingStyle":"Left hand Bat","bowlingStyle":"Left arm Fast","playingRole":"Bowler","description":"First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals."}
